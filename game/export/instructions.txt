Game

for now all you can do is pick up items and use the 
crafting bench and chest. normal movements, shift 
forward to super speed, and jump to get launched to orbit

e to open inventory

r to cheat in a rock,
t for stick (twig)
p for sharpened rock
m for mushroom
i for wood strip

to move items click on the item and click on the destination and it swaps the item positions.
if the item is surrounded by blue it is selected. To unselect click on it again

to pick up objects look at it and click it. Same for using objects such as crafting tables and chests

in the crafting table there are 6 item slots from which the item is made, one use item spot (for example use a sharp rock on a stick), 
a dropdown to pick what you are making, and an output. click on the output to creat the item. the used item and the created item will
be added back into your inventory, and the used item will lose a bit of durability (it's not visible)

if an item is used too much it might break (or at least it should i haven't tested that yet)
